As a passionate and skilled software developer, I have successfully designed and implemented a weather forecast web application. Leveraging modern technologies such as React and various API integrations, the application provides real-time weather data for locations worldwide. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development, data retrieval, and user interface design.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, allowing users to seamlessly access weather information.
Dynamic Weather Data: Through seamless integration with weather APIs, the application fetches and displays up-to-date weather data for any desired location.
Flexible Units: Users can choose between metric and imperial units to view temperature and other weather details in a format that suits their preference.
Detailed Forecasts: The application presents users with both hourly and daily weather forecasts, empowering them to plan their activities effectively.

Technologies Used:
React: Leveraging the power of React, the application efficiently manages components, state, and user interactions.
JavaScript: The project utilizes JavaScript to implement logic and handle asynchronous operations.
CSS: The custom CSS styling enhances the user interface and ensures a visually appealing experience.
API Integration: The application integrates with external weather APIs to retrieve accurate and reliable weather data.
State Management: The use of React hooks and state management ensures smooth data flow and improves overall performance.
